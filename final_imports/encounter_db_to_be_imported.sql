Mike Schmitz) is not only a podcast that repeatedly topped the podcast charts, but also one that has acted as a channel of God\'s love and mercy. The domino-effect of this show, draws listeners from across the globe and India is not one to be left behind. Since its launch in 2021, BIY is helping thousands of Indians to rediscover the richness of the Bible and the Catholic faith. In a nation with 1.4 billion souls who are in search of a deeper relationship with God, the need to bring this podcast to India in vernacular languages was very clear. Thus BIY India was born!\r\n\r\nIt didn\'t take long for Ascension to commission a team of lay people (who were deeply impacted by the podcast) to work on production, publicity and distribution. Due to the rich history of the Church in Kerala, Malayalam became the first language choice and that set the ball rolling for The Bible in a Year - Malayalam (BIYM) project.\r\n\r\nThe BIYM team ensures that they are staying true to the original podcast inspired by The Great Adventure Bible Timeline and the teachings of Jeff Cavins. At the same time, Fr. Daniel Poovannathil brings in his own unique flavour to the show.', 'storage/courses/Bible_In_a_Year_(_BIY_Malayalam_)_1737224957.jpg', '2022\r\nInspired by Fr. Mike Schmitz\'s podcast, we envisioned BIY in multiple Indian languages.\r\n\r\n2023\r\nPartnered with Ascension to adapt the Bible in a Year Podcast in Malayalam.\r\n\r\n2023\r\nConnected with Fr. Daniel Poovannathil to be the face and voice of BIYM.\r\n\r\n2024\r\nStarted production for BIYM.\r\n\r\n2025\r\nBIY India set to launch the first Indian language - Malayalam.\r\n\r\nWelcome to the official start of the Bible in a Year മലയാളം Podcast! We\'ll begin reading the Bible in the episode \"ദിവസം 1: ആരംഭം\", but before we dive into scripture, two of our team members join Fr. Daniel to lay out the context for the Early World period (Genesis 1-11). They discuss the type of scripture we\'ll encounter (Hebrew poetry) and how that affects our understanding of the Word. This episode is not part of the 365 day reading plan, but is important to help understand the readings from this period.', 'https://youtu.be/EZY6Jo74AJ4?si=-8VOkhff0sXPD2Db', 'https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/6Om3UExWVudaJWhwojFohL?utm_source=generator', 'storage/course_intro_thumb/video_thumb.png', 1, '2025-01-18 18:29:17', '2025-01-18 18:44:39');
